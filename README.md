# ToSteam - An Extension for Chrome
Have you ever started browsing the Steam store just to realize you weren't logged in when you wanted to do something like add a game to your wish-list? If so, this app is the thing for you!

Quickly and easily send a web-page to your Steam client by right-clicking on any Steam page or link and selecting "Send Site to Steam." This allows you so continue browsing right were you left off, now logged in and on the Steam client!

Features:
- Lightweight
- Open source
- Completely free
- Simple & easy to use
- Doesn't log or collect any data
- Backed by a developer who takes pride in their work

Works with `steampowered.com` and `steamcommunity.com` links.

User feedback is always appreciated as there is always room for self-improvement!
